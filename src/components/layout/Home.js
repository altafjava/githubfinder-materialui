        The responsive grid focuses on consistent spacing widths, rather than
        column width. Material Design margins and columns follow an 8px square
        baseline grid. The spacing property is an integer between 0 and 10
        inclusive. By default, the spacing between two grid items follows a
        linear function: output(spacing) = spacing * 8px, e.g. spacing={2}{' '}
        creates a 16px wide gap.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
